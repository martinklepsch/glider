# glider

An experiment in creating an as-light-as-possible starting ground
for web projects in Clojure and Clojurescript. I have a short list
of things I want to have working:

- basic Clojurescript setup
- editor agnostic browser REPL setup
- easy deployment on Heroku or via Uberjar

There are a few templates already out there that do similar things
but often they add a considerable amount of boilerplate in places
that might be confusing to beginners. I'd like to keep all the generated
code in the usual `src` source tree.
